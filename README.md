# Redrob Intelligent Candidate Ranker

A production-minded ranking system for the Redrob *Intelligent Candidate
Discovery & Ranking Challenge*. It ranks a 100,000-candidate pool against the
"Senior AI Engineer — Founding Team" job description and emits the top-100 as a
spec-compliant CSV — in **~75 seconds on a CPU, fully offline**.

The design goal is not to filter on keywords, but to **reason about fit**: who
actually did retrieval/ranking work at a product company, who is genuinely
available to hire, and who is a keyword-stuffer or an impossible-profile trap.

## AI Usage Declaration

This project was developed with AI-assisted support for brainstorming architecture, debugging guidance, and documentation refinement.

The core ranking pipeline, feature engineering, score calibration, validation logic, adversarial testing, and final submission decisions were manually implemented, reviewed, and verified.

All final outputs, scoring methodology, and deployment decisions were validated by the author.

## TL;DR — reproduce the submission

```bash
# 1. Environment (Python 3.11)
python3.11 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. One-time: fetch the semantic encoder into ./artifacts/minilm (needs network ONCE)
python fetch_model.py

# 3. Rank (no network used here; CPU only; ~75s for 100K)
python rank.py --candidates ./candidates.jsonl --out ./submission.csv

# 4. Validate format against the official validator
python validate_submission.py submission.csv     # -> "Submission is valid."
```

If `artifacts/minilm` is absent, the ranker still runs and produces a valid
submission using a **lexical + structured fallback** (no crash, no network).

## Why this architecture

The JD and the hackathon notes are explicit about the traps:

> "The right answer involves reasoning about the gap between what the JD says and
> what the JD means. A candidate who has all the AI keywords listed as skills but
> whose title is 'Marketing Manager' is not a fit."

> "A perfect-on-paper candidate who hasn't logged in for 6 months and has a 5%
> recruiter response rate is, for hiring purposes, not actually available."

So the system is built around five ideas:

| Idea | Mechanism | Defends against |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Role is a gate, not a feature** | `role_fit` from current title **and** the whole career arc; off-target careers are capped low | Keyword-stuffers (AI skills on HR/Accountant careers) |
| **Demonstrated > tagged** | `evidence_fit` reads career *prose* for real production ranking/retrieval work (cited NDCG, hybrid retrieval, recsys at scale) | Profiles that list skills but never built anything |
| **Trust, don't trust claims** | skills are weighted by endorsements, tenure, proficiency, and on-platform assessment scores | Lazily stuffed skill lists |
| **Availability is a multiplier** | behavioral signals (activity recency, response rate, interview completion, open-to-work) scale the score *down* | "Perfect on paper, impossible to hire" |
| **Impossible ⇒ dead** | honeypot detector hard-zeros physically-inconsistent profiles | The ~80 seeded honeypots (Stage-3 DQ if >10% in top-100) |

### Two-stage pipeline (fits the 5-min / 16 GB / CPU / no-network budget)

```
            ┌──────────────────────── Stage A: all 100K (cheap) ────────────────────────┐
candidates  │  load + type → honeypot detect → structured score → BM25 lexical fit        │
  .jsonl ──▶│  → provisional fused score                                                  │
            └──────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                           │ top ~4,000 by provisional score
            ┌──────────────▼──────── Stage B: shortlist only (dense) ────────────────────┐
            │  MiniLM bi-encoder cosine(JD query, candidate doc) → semantic fit            │
            └──────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                           ▼
   final = intrinsic_fit(role, semantic, skill, evidence, experience, location, education)
           × availability_multiplier × stuffer_penalty × honeypot_kill
                           ▼
                  top-100 → submission.csv
```

Encoding only the **shortlist** (not all 100K) is what keeps Stage B fast. The
heavy bottleneck — dense encoding — touches ~4K docs, not 100K.

## Scoring model

**Intrinsic fit** (additive, weights sum to 1.0):

| Component | Weight | What it captures |
|-----------|-------:|------------------|
| role      | 0.24 | title + career-discipline alignment (the anti-stuffer gate) |
| semantic  | 0.22 | dense bi-encoder fit — "beyond keywords" |
| skill     | 0.18 | trust-weighted must-have / nice-to-have skill-tag coverage |
| evidence  | 0.16 | **production retrieval/ranking work shown in career prose** (NDCG cited, "hybrid retrieval", "ranking pipeline at scale") — the JD's most emphatic signal |
| experience| 0.10 | 5–9y band (ideal 6–8, treated as a range not a gate), product-vs-services |
| location  | 0.07 | Pune/Noida preferred; NCR/Hyd/Mumbai welcome; relocation |
| education | 0.03 | tier + relevant field (light touch — JD weights skills over creds) |

The `evidence` component is deliberately separate from `skill`: the JD says to
value *demonstrated* work over a tagged skill list ("if their career history
shows they built a recommendation system, they're a fit"). It scans the
headline/summary/career **descriptions** — not the skill tags — so a candidate
who *describes* shipping a ranking system outranks one who merely *lists* the
skills. The top-10 is **10/10 stable under ±25% perturbation** of these weights,
so the ranking is driven by signal, not by precise weight calibration.

**Multiplicative modifiers** (necessary conditions, applied after):
- `availability` ∈ ~[0.4, 1.15] — behavioral signals.
- `stuffer_penalty` ∈ {0.45, 0.7, 1.0} — off-target career + high AI-skill gap.
- `honeypot_kill` ∈ {0, 1} — physically-impossible profile ⇒ 0.

Multiplicative (not additive) modifiers are deliberate: being unavailable or a
stuffer should *scale a good paper score down*, not merely subtract a constant.

## Honeypot detection

We never special-case IDs (the ground truth is hidden). We detect the physical
impossibilities a real profile cannot have (see `src/redrob_ranker/honeypot.py`):

1. A job claims more months than its own start→end window allows.
2. `expert` proficiency in a skill used for **0 months**.
3. Earliest career start implies far more career than the stated years.
4. Total tenure across roles greatly exceeds stated years of experience.
5. Three or more `expert` skills each used **< 6 months** (instant-expert).

On the released pool this flags **43 candidates**, and the produced top-100
contains **0 honeypots** and **0 off-target-title** candidates.

```

Verified on the released pool:
- `validate_submission.py` → **Submission is valid.**
- top-100: 100/100 unique scores, monotonic non-increasing, 100/100 distinct
  reasonings, 72/100 in the 5–9y band, **0 honeypots, 0 off-target titles**.

## Compute constraints — how we satisfy them

| Constraint | Limit | This system |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| Runtime | ≤ 5 min | ~75 s for 100K (hybrid); ~26 s (lexical fallback) |
| Memory | ≤ 16 GB | streams JSONL line-by-line; encodes only a 4K shortlist |
| Compute | CPU only | `device="cpu"`; no GPU calls |
| Network | off during ranking | model loaded from local `artifacts/minilm`; `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1` set in-process |
| Disk | ≤ 5 GB | ~90 MB model cache; no large intermediates |

Pre-computation (the one-time `fetch_model.py` download) is allowed to use the
network and sits outside the 5-minute ranking window, per spec §10.3.

---

## Sandbox

`app.py` is a Streamlit app that accepts a ≤100-candidate JSONL sample, runs the
full pipeline on CPU, and offers the ranked CSV for download. Deploy free on
HuggingFace Spaces or Streamlit Cloud (`streamlit run app.py` locally).

## Roadmap — and what we can built later

These are the production successors to this PoC. Each was a conscious scoping
decision, not an oversight — worth stating plainly because the reasoning matters
more than the code.

1. **Offline eval harness + sensitivity analysis.** The fusion weights are
   *reasoned*, not *tuned*, because the ground truth is hidden. A proxy relevance
   label built from the same role/skill/experience signals the ranker uses would
   be **circular** — tuning against it grades our own homework. The honest
   versions are (i) regression checks and (ii) sensitivity analysis (perturb
   weights ±20%, confirm the top-100 is stable). We left these out to keep the
   submission lean given the 3-submission cap and no live leaderboard; they are
   the first thing to add with any real labeled data.

2. **Learning-to-rank (XGBoost/neural).** Explicitly **rejected** for this
   PoC. LTR needs labeled relevance judgments; with none, an LTR model would only
   re-learn our hand-built proxy's biases while *removing* the interpretability
   that makes the current scorer auditable and defensible. The transparent
   rule-based scorer is the correct choice in a no-ground-truth setting — and the
   JD's distrust of "frameworks over systems" reinforces that. LTR becomes the
   right move only once genuine recruiter-feedback labels exist.

3. **Generic JD parsing.** `jobspec.py` is hand-encoded for this one role. A
   product would parse arbitrary JDs into that same structured form (vocabularies,
   anti-signals, weights). Out of scope for a single-JD challenge, but the clean
   separation between `jobspec.py` and the scorers is exactly the seam where a
   parser would plug in.

The throughline: in a setting with **no ground truth and a hard reproducibility
bar**, an interpretable, trap-resistant, fast ranker beats an opaque model that
merely *looks* more sophisticated.
